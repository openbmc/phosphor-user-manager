      "message": "D-Bus signals generally used for communication between applications, allows one D-bus app to notify each other about important events or changes.\n\nIn this case, The D-bus app itself monitoring its own D-bus signals which I never seen in any OpenBMC apps.\n\nSince its the same D-bus app which knows about D-bus property changes, this can be achieved without monitoring D-bus signals as well.\nI agree that it works functionally but we need to check if there any corner cases where D-bus signals missed..",

      "message": "This is to avoid spreading serialisation call though out the code whenever there is a change in properties. Otherwise we should be add the code for all property set functions and in some cases we may unnecessarily overrides the property setting function just for serialising it.\n\nI don\u0027t see any reason we miss signals for pesistable properties. If misses it is bug in property handling not in serialisation code.",
