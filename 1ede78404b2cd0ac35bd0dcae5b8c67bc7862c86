      "message": "The code is fine but this commit message does not make much sense.\n\n\"during vexing parse\"?\n\n\"Vexing parse\" is a way to describe the fact that C++ constructors like this are ambiguous between a function pointer declaration and a constructor call.  It is vexing [annoying] because variable definitions are usually \u003ctype\u003e \u003cvariable\u003e(\u003cargs\u003e); except when args is empty and then it magically becomes a function pointer definition.\n\nIt use to be that GCC would \"figure out what you intended\" even though the parse is ambiguous.  Now, with newer GCC and -Wall it is telling you \"what you\u0027re doing is ambiguous and I\u0027m not going to take it anymore\".\n\nAll you\u0027re doing here is fixing the ambiguous variable declaration to be clearly a declaration+construction rather than a function pointer by replacing the () with {}.",
