Can you make a smaller commit in meta-phosphor that just updates this path so that if this commit gets merged we don\u0027t end up in a blocked state?\n\nIt appears from my grep (and I could be missing something) that there is exactly one file that should be updated:\n\nmeta-phosphor/recipes-phosphor/certificate/phosphor-nslcd-cert-config/env:CERTPATH\u003d/etc/nslcd/certs/cert.pem",

      "message": "But like I said, that commit is doing a lot more than just changing the path.  Your commits could be accepted a lot easier if they do exactly one change.  Glomming it into another, tangential change means it is harder to review, has more co-reqs, and thus reviewers naturally do not put the urgency on it.",
