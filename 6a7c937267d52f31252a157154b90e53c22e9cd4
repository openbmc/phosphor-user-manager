      "message": "Why?  What are we trying to accomplish that isn\u0027t accomplished by simply increasing the default?  I\u0027m pretty sure that 30 was picked arbitrarily as a \"we should have some limit\", but not a lot of thought was put into it.  IPMI already has a limit of 16, so we\u0027re past that by default with 30, so that isn\u0027t a concern.  If we increased this to, say, 128, could we avoid the option altogether?\n\nWhat limit would you expect to set here?",

      "message": "If we set it to 1000 by default, and create 1000 users, what is the impact to the ROFS size?\n\nYou\u0027re right, 1000 is probably beyond where we could just do it without thinking about it, although I suspect that a lot of forks already have some mod like this, given they support LDAP.  If we can just change the default to 1000, that would be better.\n\nIf we\u0027re setting 1000, do we need to reorganize the dbus interfaces to make subfolders for the users?  An introspect of 1000 users sounds like a very long file.  How does the mapper operate in that case?  How does redfish AccountService operate?",
