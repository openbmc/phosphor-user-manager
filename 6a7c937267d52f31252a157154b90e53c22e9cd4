      "message": "Why?  What are we trying to accomplish that isn\u0027t accomplished by simply increasing the default?  I\u0027m pretty sure that 30 was picked arbitrarily as a \"we should have some limit\", but not a lot of thought was put into it.  IPMI already has a limit of 16, so we\u0027re past that by default with 30, so that isn\u0027t a concern.  If we increased this to, say, 128, could we avoid the option altogether?\n\nWhat limit would you expect to set here?",

You shouldn\u0027t be asking a contributor to add an additional feature as part of a different commit.\n\nIPMI has limits due to the spec and the way passwords are required to be stored in plain-text.
